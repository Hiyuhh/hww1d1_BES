Optimizing Text Messaging App with Efficient Data Structures
-------------------------------------------

Task 1: Message Storage and Retrieval:

Arrays: Arrays can be used to store messages in the order they were recieved.

Linked Lists: Linked lists can efficiently support insertion and deletion of messages at any position.

Hash Tables: Hash tables can provide fast message retrieval by using a hash function to map message IDs to their corresponding messages.

Trees: Trees can be used to efficiently store and retrieve messages based on their timestamps or other attributes.(most suitable choice for a text messaging app.)

Task 2: Real-Time Updates:

Polling: Polling involves the client periodically sending requests to the server to check for updates. 

Long-Polling: Long-polling keeps the connection open until new data is available, reducing latency compared to regular polling.

Websockets: WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. Allowing real-time updates to be pushed from the server to the client without continuous polling.(most suitable choice for a text messaging app.)

Task 3: Conversation List Management:

Sorting: Implement sorting algorithms based on timestamp or conversation metadata to display conversations in a meaningful order.

Filtering: Use filters to allow users to view conversations based on specific criteria.

Indexing: Maintain indexes for conversations to speed up retrieval.

Analyzing Big O Complexity for a Sorting Algorithm
-------------------------------------------

def simple_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

Task 1: Identifying Key Operations

Initializing a variable (n) with the length of the input array
Outer loop: Iterating (n) times
Inner loop: Iterating (n-i-1) times in each iteration of the outer loop
Comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order

Task 2: Calculating Big O Complexity
the Big O complexity of the provided sorting algorithm is O(n**2), where n is the size of the input array.

Task 3: Efficiency Analysis:

Merge Sort: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works well for large datasets.

Quick Sort: Quick sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that has an average time complexity

Heap Sort: Heap sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, it guarantees efficient performance for sorting tasks.
